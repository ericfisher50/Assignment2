<h1> Mission Statement </h1>

The goal of the Barrier Reef Orchestra's new website is to attract a larger (particularly younger) audience at their events and also to keep a regularly attending audience. 
 
<h1> Success Evaluation </h1>

The most accurate way to measure the success of the website is to track attendance demographics at the orchestra's events. Taking note of particular points of interest such as: 
<ul> <li> Total attendance - This can be calculated through total ticket sales or by counting patrons at the door to the event.</li> 
<li> Purchases of student/youth tickets - This can be calculated by keeping track of how many student/youth tickets are bought. The ticket purchasing process could also require a DOB entry, which would be even more beneficial to determining the demographics of the concert.  </li> 
<li> Taking note of whether or not a patron has attended an event before or not. This can be done by offering the customers the option to register on the website in order to speed up the purchase process in future ticket transactions. </li></ul>

<h1> Target Audience </h1>

The target audience will be people with a general interest in music. The website will implement an educational compenent to cater to that demographic, offering information on points of interest such as famous musicians and musicians in the BRO. <br>

The website will aim to target younger audiences which will mean that the website will be designed to be more captivating and interactive to develop their interest in the website and the BRO events. The website must be designed in similar stanards to current websites in order to keep the interest of a tech-savvy younger audience.
