<h1> Mission Statement </h1>

The goal of the Barrier Reef Orchestra's new website is to attract a larger (particularly younger) audience at their events. 
 
<h1> Success Evaluation </h1>

The most accurate way to measure the success of the website is to track attendance demographics at BRO events. Taking note of particular points of interest such as attendance, purchases of student/youth tickets and if possible determining whether or not the attendees are returning customers or not. 

<h1> Target Audience </h1>

The target audience will be people with a general interest in music. The website will implement an educational compenent to cater to that demographic.

The website will also aim to target younger audiences which will mean that the website will be designed to be more captivating and interactive to develop their interest in the website and the BRO events.
